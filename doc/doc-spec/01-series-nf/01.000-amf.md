# 01.000 AMF (Access Management Function)

## 1. Introduction

AMF (Access Management Function) is the first network function for external identities to initialize and register in the Veil-link system. For external interfaces, AMF provides the N1 interface, using SCTP connections between identities and the AMF itself.

After identity initialization, a client identity may need to register data plane session establishment. In this situation, AMF helps the identity transfer the request to the destination network function, SMF.

For the Veil-link system itself, AMF manages all identity conditions in the system and also provides this information to OAM for management.

## 2. N1 Interface

N1 Interface will be established between AMF and identities, including client identity, server identity, and router under SCTP connection.

The protocol used at N1 interface is IAP. For IAP in detail, please refer to [05.000 IAP](../05-series-protocol/05.000-iap.md).
